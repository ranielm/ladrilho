# AZUL-ONLINE: Fix Host Black Screen When Player Joins

**Date:** 2026-01-13

## Changes:

- `frontend/src/store/gameStore.ts`: Updated setRoom and setGameState to support functional updates

## Summary:

Fixed a bug where the host would see a black screen when a second player joined the room. The issue was that the Zustand store's setRoom and setGameState functions only accepted direct values, but the useSocket hook was passing functional updates when handling the onPlayerJoined event. The store now properly detects when a function is passed and calls it with the previous state, enabling proper state updates when players join or leave.

- `frontend/src/i18n/useLanguage.ts`: Zustand store with localStorage persistence for language preference
- `frontend/src/components/UI/LanguageSelector.tsx`: Language toggle component (PT/EN)
- `frontend/src/App.tsx`: Added LanguageSelector and translations
- `frontend/src/components/Room/CreateRoom.tsx`: Translated all UI strings
- `frontend/src/components/Room/JoinRoom.tsx`: Translated all UI strings
- `frontend/src/components/Room/Lobby.tsx`: Translated all UI strings
- `frontend/src/components/Game/GameBoard.tsx`: Translated all UI strings
- `frontend/src/components/Game/GameOver.tsx`: Translated all UI strings
- `frontend/src/components/Board/Board.tsx`: Translated all UI strings
- `frontend/src/components/Factory/FactoryDisplay.tsx`: Translated all UI strings
- `frontend/src/styles/globals.css`: Adjusted tile colors for better saturation and visibility

## Summary:

Added internationalization (i18n) support with Portuguese (PT-BR) and English (EN-US) languages. The language selector appears in the top-right corner of all screens and the preference is persisted in localStorage. All user-facing strings across the application are now translatable. Also improved tile colors to be more saturated and visually distinct while maintaining a professional appearance without excessive glow effects.

# AZUL-ONLINE: Fix Mobile Touch Events for Tile Placement

**Date:** 2026-01-14

## Changes:

- `frontend/src/components/Board/PatternLines.tsx`: Replaced motion.div with regular div, switched onClick/onTouchEnd to onPointerUp for cross-platform touch support
- `frontend/src/components/Board/FloorLine.tsx`: Replaced motion.div with regular div, switched onClick/onTouchEnd to onPointerUp for cross-platform touch support

## Summary:

Fixed mobile touch events where users could select tiles from factories but could not place them on pattern lines by tapping. The issue was that Framer Motion's motion.div with onTouchEnd was not properly firing events on some mobile browsers. Replaced motion.div with regular div elements and switched to onPointerUp events which provide unified mouse and touch handling across all platforms. Added e.stopPropagation() to prevent event bubbling issues.

# AZUL-ONLINE: Game State Persistence with SQLite Auto-Save

**Date:** 2026-01-14

## Changes:

- `backend/src/persistence/database.ts`: New SQLite persistence module using better-sqlite3
- `backend/src/room/store.ts`: Added auto-save on every game state change, load from DB on startup
- `backend/src/server.ts`: Initialize database and load persisted rooms before accepting connections
- `backend/package.json`: Added better-sqlite3 and @types/better-sqlite3 dependencies
- `frontend/src/hooks/useSocket.ts`: Switched from sessionStorage to localStorage for room/player IDs

## Summary:

Implemented game state persistence using SQLite (better-sqlite3) so players can close their browser and return to continue their game later. The server auto-saves room state to the database on every action (room creation, player join/leave, game moves). On server startup, all persisted rooms are loaded back into memory with players marked as disconnected. Frontend now uses localStorage instead of sessionStorage so reconnection data survives browser restarts. Rooms are automatically cleaned up after 48 hours of inactivity. To configure the database path on Render.com, set the `DB_PATH` environment variable (e.g., `/var/data/azul.db`).

# AZUL-ONLINE: Migrate to Turso Cloud Database

**Date:** 2026-01-14

## Changes:

- `backend/src/persistence/database.ts`: Migrated from better-sqlite3 to @libsql/client for Turso cloud SQLite
- `backend/src/room/store.ts`: Updated to use async database operations with fire-and-forget pattern
- `backend/src/server.ts`: Made createServer async to await database initialization
- `backend/src/index.ts`: Added async main function wrapper for server startup
- `backend/package.json`: Replaced better-sqlite3 with @libsql/client

## Summary:

Migrated from local SQLite (better-sqlite3) to Turso cloud database (@libsql/client) because Render.com free tier doesn't support persistent disks. Turso provides free cloud-hosted SQLite that persists across server restarts and deploys. The database operations are now async but use fire-and-forget pattern for writes to avoid blocking game actions. Configuration requires two environment variables on Render: `TURSO_DATABASE_URL` and `TURSO_AUTH_TOKEN`. The system gracefully falls back to in-memory only mode if Turso credentials are not configured.
