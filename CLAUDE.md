# AZUL-ONLINE: Fix Host Black Screen When Player Joins

**Date:** 2026-01-13

## Changes:

- `frontend/src/store/gameStore.ts`: Updated setRoom and setGameState to support functional updates

## Summary:

Fixed a bug where the host would see a black screen when a second player joined the room. The issue was that the Zustand store's setRoom and setGameState functions only accepted direct values, but the useSocket hook was passing functional updates when handling the onPlayerJoined event. The store now properly detects when a function is passed and calls it with the previous state, enabling proper state updates when players join or leave.

The language selector appears in the top-right corner of all screens and the preference is persisted in localStorage. All user-facing strings across the application are now translatable.

# AZUL-ONLINE: Fix Mobile Touch Events for Tile Placement

**Date:** 2026-01-14

## Changes:

- `frontend/src/components/Board/PatternLines.tsx`: Added onTouchEnd handler, touchAction: manipulation style, increased min-height to 44px
- `frontend/src/components/Board/FloorLine.tsx`: Added onTouchEnd handler, touchAction: manipulation style, increased min-height to 44px
- `frontend/src/components/Tile/Tile.tsx`: Added onTouchEnd handler, touchAction: manipulation style for better mobile support

## Summary:

Fixed mobile touch events where users could select tiles from factories but could not place them on pattern lines by tapping. The issue was that onClick handlers were not reliably triggered on mobile touch devices. Added onTouchEnd handlers with e.preventDefault() to all interactive elements (PatternLines, FloorLine, Tile) to ensure touch events are properly captured. Applied touchAction: 'manipulation' CSS to eliminate 300ms tap delay and prevent double-tap zoom. Increased minimum touch target heights to 44px following mobile accessibility guidelines.
